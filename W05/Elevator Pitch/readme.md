# Elevator Pitch

## Elevator Pitch for my website: 
#### I am planning to create a website for tourists who visit South Korea. Think about the last time you made plan for your trip. Planning is the most important part for traveling somewhere especially when you trip the places you had never been. The website will help people who planning to go to South Korea for travel. It will provide places by categories, so people can find easily where they want to go.




## Feedbacks from my firends

* ### Jaeeon Yoo: 
    #### She wants the website to have more specific categories.
* ### Gubin Lee:
    #### He said that if the places divided by areas so people can save their time and    convenient for them to find where to go.
* ### Jinhyun Park: 
    #### He wants the website have descriptions not just putting pictures on it.         Descriptions may bring peopleâ€™s interest.
